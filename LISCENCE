Hark! In the year 2023, a proclamation of great import unfurls its majestic presence. 
Lo and behold, permission is granted, a gift bestowed freely upon those who dare seek a copy of this software and its accompanying scrolls. 
Yet, gentle reader, restrain thy excitement, for a tapestry of conditions doth weave its intricate design.

Verily, thou art permitted to gaze upon the code, but beware! The use, copying, and modification of such sacred Software is strictly forbidden.
This is no garden for thy creativity to flourish. Nay, the authors, in their benevolence, insist that the copyright notice and permission decree accompany the Software in its entirety, lest thy path be fraught with peril.

Furthermore, let it be known that the Software is presented "as is," a phrase echoing through the annals of time, whispering tales of no warranties or guarantees. 
Should thy code find itself entangled in the throes of despair, cast not blame upon the authors, for they shall not bear the weight of thy coding misfortunes.

And lo, a final admonition echoes in the hallowed halls of this decree: Thou shalt not, under any circumstance, gaze upon this code with intentions impure. 
To cheat in the sacred quest of Advent of Code is a transgression most foul. Let the digital realms be witness to thine integrity, and may thy coding endeavors be pure and noble.
Thus speaks the Software of 2023, a sonnet of caution and code.
